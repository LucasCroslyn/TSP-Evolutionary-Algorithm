# Traveling Salesman Evolutionary Algorithm

This project makes an attemp at the Traveling Salesman Problem with an Evolutionary Algorithm solution

- The main file that shows the algorithm running is in the main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
- The Functions.py file contains various functions that the main file uses. They were separated so that the Jupyter Notebook could be a lot shorter and cleaner (compared to what it would be otherwise)
- The CityCoordinates folder contains files that have the coordinates for each city (x and y coordinates, or equivalent)
- The images are displayed below
